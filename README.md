# ExpressJS Crash Course

Code created from the
[ExpressJS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnsO8-xJ8rs)
and update the code to use the official mongodb node driver following the
[Node.js + Express - Tutorial - Insert and Get Data with MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwrOXl5TDI).


Demos:
  - express
  - express-validator
  - body-parser
  - mongo db (in a docker containers) and mongodb

The code tests the npm module mongojs and mongodb.
Use the mongodb module for all future projects because:
  - it is the offical monogodb driver for node,
  - the npm stats show that this module is far more popular
